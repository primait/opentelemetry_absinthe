# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2022-09-20
* opentelemetry_absinthe does not set opentelemetry-related Logger metadata anymore, because
  The OpenTelemetry API/SDK itself [does that automatically since 1.1.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang/pull/394).
  If you're upgrading to opentelemetry_absinthe 1.1.0, it is therefore recommended to also upgrade to OpenTelemetry API 1.1.0
  in order to keep the opentelemetry log metadata.
